# Enclosure

This is the 3D CAD model of my enclosure, designed by my talented friend, mechanical engineer Vinod Seluam. It features four M4 screw threads and a reinforced structure to ensure durability, as the material will need to withstand foot pressure to activate the 3PDT foot-stomp switch. The printing process took approximately 12 hours. A big thank you to Vinod for his outstanding work on this design.
