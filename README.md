# Bass-Synth-Pedal
A budget-friendly bass synthesizer pedal with square and triangle wave generation, designed and built for a university project. The objective of this project is to design and build a bass synthesizer pedal within a 20-euro budget. This budgetary constraint was not chosen out of necessity but as a deliberate design decision to limit the project's complexity and emphasize resourceful engineering.

The resulting pedal, named Son of Coulomb, processes the sinusoidal input signal from a bass guitar and offers several unique features. A dedicated switch allows the user to transform the input signal into either a triangular or square waveform. Another switch enables frequency multiplication, offering the option to shift the output one or two octaves higher (frequency multiplied by 2x or 4x).

The PCB design includes exposed pins for a microcontroller, allowing users to develop and upload custom effects. By connecting the microcontroller via jumpers, you can replace the default effect, which shifts the input signal one or two octaves up, with any custom effect of your choice through programming. This feature enhances the pedal's versatility and adaptability for creative experimentation.

Additionally, the pedal includes a 3PDT true bypass functionality, providing the user with seamless control to toggle between the unprocessed bass sound and the synthesized effect. This combination of simplicity, functionality, and cost-efficiency makes the Son of Coulomb an excellent showcase of analog signal processing and creative circuit design.
